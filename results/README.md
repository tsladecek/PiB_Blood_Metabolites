# RESULTS 

Folders contain the results of the analyses - mostly in csv format. These are of two types:

- [model]_best.csv - results from the gridsearch and *pickbest* function in the gridsearch scripts for regression and classification

- [class]_metrics.csv - results from cross-validation for the different metrics. 

For more information about how the files were generated, go to `../scripts/cluster_scripts`
