# Prediction of Age and Sex from Blood Metabolites

### Projects in Bioinformatics (Fall 2019)

The study uses data from KarMeN study - specifically the information on blood metabolite levels in 
individuals of both sexes and of different ages. Additionally, for women the menopausal status was 
ascertained. 

We focused on predictions of all these manifestations, with a help of many different machine 
learning methods. This project offers a comparison of different modelling methods, their easiness of 
use, hyperparameter tuning, means of validation, final model selection and ways to interpret the 
results.
